📊 Netflix Dashboard — Data Visualization Project
Hi! I'm Pranjal 👋
This is a Netflix Data Dashboard I created using Tableau Public to visually explore patterns in Netflix’s content library.

💡 Project Idea
The goal of this project was to gain insights into the types of content available on Netflix — movies vs. TV shows, their release years, genre breakdowns, and much more — by creating an interactive, easy-to-read dashboard.

📁 What this Dashboard Shows
Content Type: Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows
Genre: Most common genres across the platform
Release Year Trend: Year-wise trend of content being added
Country-wise Data: Top countries producing Netflix content
Ratings Breakdown: Content ratings across various categories
I used filters and interactive elements so you can explore the data on your own — try clicking around the charts!

📊 Tools Used
Tableau Public — for creating the dashboard
CSV Dataset — Netflix data from Kaggle (cleaned using Excel)

🤔 Why I Made This
As someone who loves both Netflix and data, I thought — why not combine them?
This dashboard was also a great way to improve my data visualization skills while working on a topic that I genuinely enjoy.

🧠 What I Learned
How to clean and structure messy data for visualizations
Building interactive dashboards with filters, highlights, and tooltips
Understanding real-world patterns in content platforms like Netflix
